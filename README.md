#Challenge 1 Text

## Overview of Project
Louise requested an analysis of theater campaign outcome based on launch date & plays campaign outcomes based on goals.

## Analysis and Challenges
In Outcomes Based on Launch Date, the challenges included
-Adjusting the chart to get rid of the line break for a value of zero in October

In Outcomes Based on Goals for play, the challenges included 
-Adjusting data for zero value in percentages
-Hiding columns to display chart with relevant data
-Referencing correct columns for the COUNTIFS formula


## Results
###Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
-Campaigns during the spring and summer months are overall more successful
-Roughly the difference between successful and failed campaigns is about 20%

###Summary of Limitations 
The information presented here includes all countries. For more relevant data specific to Louise’s production campaign further analysis should be performed specific to the target country. 

The same charts could be explored filtered for the US or GB as those are Louise’s target countrie
